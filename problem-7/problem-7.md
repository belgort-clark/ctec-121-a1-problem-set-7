## Double Your Money

Using the future value code from  Module 2 (Chapter 2 in the textbook), write a Python program that uses a while looop
to determine how many years it will take to double an investment.

The input will be an annualized interest rate, and the output is the number of years it takes and investment to bule.

Note: The amount of the initial investment does not matter; you can use $1.00 if you want. You can also use your own value.

Your function must be named **doubleInvestment()**.
